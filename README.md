# Check_in_System
this is a software i am building (not yet completed) that is inspired from my time i used to work at "Royal Jordanain" where i dealt directly with a complete system of the check_in porcedures for flights;
In this project i am using a MySQL database;
All the commented lines in the "App.java" file were used to add some data to the database;
i made a connection first to my dataBase using JDBC driver;
i then executed some SQL queries so i can edit my dataSet;
i turned all of my objects into a serialized form so i can insert them in my dataset into a BLOB column;

NOTE:the software is not yet done.
